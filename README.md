# seizure-prediction
Here are my codes for an epileptic seizure prediction (a kaggle competition).
you can find the MATLAB code that I wrote for this competition:
[Melbourne University AES/MathWorks/NIH Seizure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/melbourne-university-seizure-prediction/leaderboard)

In this competition I became 6th on the public leader-board but then 25th on the private one. It was due to the fact that competition's scores were computed by AUC in a very weird way : a single AUC for 3 different patientsâ€¦ Anyway.. it was a fun competition full of  opportunities to learn.
